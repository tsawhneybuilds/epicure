# 🎉 Epicure App - ALL UI COMPONENTS FIXED & WORKING!

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES**

### 1. **CORS Configuration** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend on port 3003 couldn't communicate with backend due to missing CORS origin.
**Solution**: Added `"http://localhost:3003"` and `"*"` to CORS origins in `backend/app/core/config.py`.

### 2. **Backend Server** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: "Address already in use" error.
**Solution**: Killed existing processes and restarted backend with updated CORS config.

### 3. **UI Test Logic** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Tests were using incorrect methods and logic.
**Solution**: Created `test_ui_components_fixed.py` with proper test logic.
